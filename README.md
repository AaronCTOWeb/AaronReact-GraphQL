# Eucalyptus Coding Exercise

Congratulations on being selected for our coding exercise! You're reading this because we see potential in you and we're excited to see more of your technical side.

This coding exercise contains real challenges that we've encountered at Eucalyptus, and we hope they will give you an opportunity to demonstrate how you approach and tackle software problems.

We'd love to have your submission within the next 7 days, but please reach out if other commitments prevent this.

Overall, we expect that this will take you 2-3 hours, and we'd prefer you to not spend more time than this. If you're running close to three hours, we would suggest ensuring the code is in a runnable state and then documenting what additional changes you would have made if you had more time.

## Getting started

If you've been asked to complete a specific takehome, you can find information about it within the relevant folders' README. If you haven't, then feel free to choose the project you feel best demonstrates your skillset. Please only complete **one**

- **Quiz interface**: Creating a backend service to interpret information from questionnaires.
- **Feature flag client**: Creating a frontend client to interface with a feature flag provider.

## Submission
